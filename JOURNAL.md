(This was written after my project, so this will only be the end of the development.)

# July 7th 2025

I added 2 rotary encoders and linked them up. (I changed the 3d models accordingly later.)

Probably fixed up the case.

(3-ish hours)


# July 8th 2025

I resubmitted my project and got a tip from Logan (@Logan Peterson on Hackclub Slack) that I should make my case design more intricate. 

I decided to make the name of my keyboard more visible, so I added a big ‘WIND47’ on the back, drew a few waves on top and on the bottom of the text and extruded the middle inwards. Also added holes for the rotary encoders.

Also had a massive fight with Shapr3d, Fusion, KiCad and the lack of 3d models (and the lack of storage :sob:).

(6-ish hours)


## July 10th 2025

09:08 - I realized I didn’t put a usb-c port opening on my 3d file :see-no-evil:. I will try to make it in Shapr3d.

I noticed that the microcontroller was going through the floor so I lowered the floor down from 3mm to 1.5mm. I added the port opening, and rounded the edges.
